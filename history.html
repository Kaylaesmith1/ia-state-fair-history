        <h3>Beginning in 1854, the Iowa State Fair is an annual state fair held in Des Moines, Iowa. It lasts for 11 days in mid-August and has been held on the Iowa State Fairgrounds in the capital city of Des Moines since 1886. With over a million visitors it's one of the largest and best known state fairs in the United States.
Since its start, the Iowa State Fair has only been cancelled six times, most recently in 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic.
